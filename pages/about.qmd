Welcome to our lab website! We are glad you are here.

We are a friendly, interdisciplinary group of researchers at Ohio State University looking to make better fruits and vegetables 🍅🍏🍎🍓🌱

We do lots of cool research activities including:

- analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry
- growing plants in the field and greenhouse
- conducting nutritional animal studies and human clinical trials
- bioinformatics and multi-omic integration

If you are potentially interested in joining our team, please send Jess an email including the following information:

- a short CV
- a short paragraph on why you are interested in our group
- (for prospective grad students) what degree and program you’re interested in

**Prospective graduate students:** <br>
Both Horticulture and Crop Science, and Food Science and Technology are direct admit programs (i.e., no rotations), so students will only be admitted once they have found a faculty adviser to support them (both financially and with mentorship) during their degree. For this reason, it’s important to reach out before the application process!

Students interested to start in the Summer or Fall should have completed applications by Nov 30 of the previous year. Most discussions with prospective students occur in Summer/early Fall.

If you have any questions about the application process, please reach out to Jess via email.
