We are open to new collaborative projects and helping you with fee-for-service analyses. We regularly work with other academics and those in industry. We typically use UHPLC, UHPLC-MS/MS, and UHPLC-QTOF-MS to do quantitative analysis, compound ID/discovery, and metabolomics experiments. If you are interested in working with us, please send Jess an email and she can provide additional information, including capability and [pricing](files/fee-schedule.pdf).
